# Text Schema Validator
This project was implemented in 2 parts, ValidatorFrontend implemented using AngularJS framework for rapid development and ValidatorRESTService implmented using Jersey framework.  ValidatorRESTService now contains the integrated project.

## Getting Started
Download ValidatorRESTService


### ValidatorRESTService
Running the backend requires source code and Tomcat.

#### Building the project
We used Apache Maven for building the project and produing .war file.  Please see link below for more information on Maven.
https://maven.apache.org

#### Web Server
We used Apache Tomcat for hosting the RESTful server.  Please see link below for installation and launch instructions.

## ValidatorFrontend
This AngularJS project only contains the frontend portion of the project.  This is no longer needed as all necessary files are migrated to ValidatorRESTService

### ValidatorFrontend
All necessary components are already installed.
#### Run the Application
We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is to open a terminal window, navigate to the project folder, and run the following command:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
